### Hi fellows ✌🏽

To get you started, here are a few things about me:

- 🏦 I am currently working on a very cool project at @Accenture!
- 👨🏾‍💻 I am currently improving my software engineering & communications skills, as well as exploring new technologies.
- 🤝 I am looking forward to collaborating on projects/tools that improve (or at least have the intention to improve) software development.

A little more about me:

I am a full-stack developer, working mainly with JavaScript and other cool tools for building web and mobile apps.
I was born in Mozambique (a beautiful country in Southern Africa) and currently based in Berlin (my second home).
I have worked in different industries, from retail-banking to self-thought video creator, until I have decided few years ago to give it a second try in the ###'computer things'### a.k.a IT industry (yes, in 2005 I was enrolled in a computer science undergraduate program, that I ended up dropping it out after two semesters). I hold a bachelor of science degree in web development, and a full-stack web development bootcamp certification from both SAE Institute and Le wagon Berlin (besides few short courses certification in C#.Net, Java, HTML & CSS and others). My next short-medium term goal is to get an AWS Developer Associate certification. 
Continuing to learn about software engineering, and sharing my success & failure as I grow, is my actual focus.📚

Some of the tools & framework I use:

### Frontend
- HTML & SCSS 
- Angular & ReactJS
- Ionic
- StencilJS (Web Components)

### Content Management
- Contentful (headless CMS)

### Backend
- NodeJs

Stay safe😷 & healthy🥑
