### Hi fellows ✌🏽

I am a full-Stack web developer working with Javascript and the MERN stack. I was born in Mozambique (a beautiful country in southern Africa) and currently living in Berlin (my second home). I have worked in different industries, from Finance (at the Bank) to self-thought video creator, until I have decided three years ago to pursue the dream I had when I was 10 years old ( be like the cool nerd kids I used to watch on tv 😅). Continuing to learn about software development and sharing what I know is my actual focus.

Stay safe😷 & healthy🥑
